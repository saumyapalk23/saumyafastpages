    "Topic 8.1, 8.2 Consider the following code segment. int[][] anArray = new int[10][8]; for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) { for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) { anArray[j][k] = 5; } } The code segment causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown. How many elements in anArray will be set to 5 before the exception is thrown? We answered 64 but this would not thrown an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Instead, 8 elements in anArray will be set to 5 before an exception is thrown since anArray has 8 columns, numbered 0 through 7, inclusive.\n",

The correct answer is \"str = str.substring(pos + 1);\" since in the while loop, the variable pos is assigned the position of the first occurrence of \"A\" in str. If pos is less than zero, there are no more occurrences of \"A\" and the value of count is returned. Otherwise, the value of count is incremented and str is updated by removing the initial characters of str, up to and including the occurrence of \"A\" that was last included in count. The statement str = str.substring(pos + 1) accomplishes the update by selecting characters of str starting one character after pos.\n",

The correct answer is \"3 3\" because the code segment iterates over the elements of data. Whenever an element is greater than the next element, the next element is printed. Because 4 is greater than the next element (3), 3 is printed. Because 5 is greater than the next element (3), another 3 is printed.\n",

The element at index 3, which is 5, is greater than 3, so 3 is printed. The element at index 2, which is 4, is greater than 2, so 2 is printed. The element at index 1, which is 2, is greater than 1, so 1 is printed. The element at index 0, which is 0, is not greater than 0, so 0 is not printed.\n",

When word is assigned “compiler” and howFar is assigned 3, the value of word.substring(howFar + 1, word.length()) is “iler”. This is the substring of “compiler” beginning at 3 + 1 or 4 and ending at 8 – 1 or 7. The value of word.substring(0, howFar) is “com”. This is the substring of “compiler” beginning at 0 and ending at 2. The method returns “ilercom”.\n",

    "D is Correct. The method assigns the shortest string that occurs in any element of arr between arr[n] and arr[arr.length - 1], inclusive, to result[n]. The shortest string found between arr[0] and arr[3] is \"of\", so result[0] is assigned the value \"of\". The shortest string found between arr[1] and arr[3] is also \"of\", so result[1] is also assigned the value \"of\". The same is true for the part of the array that begins at index 2 and ends at index 3, so result[2] is also assigned the value \"of\". In the last iteration of the outer for loop, there are no values to consider after arr[3], so result[3] is assigned the value \"spring\".\n",

The code segment uses an enhanced for loop to traverse the valueList array. The statement inside the loop calls the getNum method to access the num instance variable. Option III is incorrect.
