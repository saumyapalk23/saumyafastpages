    "The distance away from the goal is defined as dist while the number of jumps given is defined as numHops so if we call the method FrogSimulation using FrogSimulation sim= new FrogSimulation(24,5);. The simulation would have a goal at a distance of 24 inches and a maximum amount of 5 jumps.

    "First we define location to be at zero, our starting point. Then we use a for loop so that i will continue to increase until it reaches the max number of hops and so that for as long as this happens, the frog will hop (ie. location= location+hopDistance, which means that the distance the frog jumps will be added to location every time the frog jumps in order to have the final location of the frog). After the frog has finished jumping, we used an if loop so that if the frog is at or beyond the goal then it will be true and if it is at a negative value or behind the starting value then it will return false. If the frog has used up all its jumps but has not made it to the goal or at a negative value then it will return false regardless which is done by a return false outside of the for loop.  \n"

    "This is a method called runSimulations and basically if we call this method such as FrogSimulation run = new FrogSimulation(23); it should run the simulation 23 times and count the number of successes- which will eventually be changed into a decimal of successes/tries. We do this by setting the number of successes to zero to begin with and then we use a for loop, with basically the same idea as part a, so that the code will run for as many times as directed. Then inside of that for loop, we have an if loop so that for as long as simulate runs true then the success counter will increase and the proportion of successes/tries will be returned"
