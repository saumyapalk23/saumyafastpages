## Video Notes

* culture has molded stress
* stress takes its toll and it takes its toll in a way the students don't sometimes want to admit and that's what
* students are so depressed these days and feel lonely
* research shows that we can control a lot more of our happiness 
* all good things in life start by taking control 
* when looking at enterprise, you must recognize that intuition doesn't work work; mind is often lying to you
* people who seek out material aspirations are actually statistically more likely to have lower well-being than people who tend not to seek out material aspirations
* we need to embrace if we're gonna embark on what we need to do
* helping others helps us more than we think
* make time for gratitude
* half hour of cardio exercise every day is equivalent to taking an anti-depression medication on the market just a half hour a day

* take time to be in the present moment 
* become affluent not in wealth but in time
